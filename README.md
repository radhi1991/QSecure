## How the App Works

### Functionality Overview
QSecure Exchange allows users to securely share files and sensitive information within their organization. The application ensures that all data is encrypted during transmission, providing a secure environment for communication. The application's core functionality includes:

*   Secure file sharing: Users can upload and share files with other users within their organization.
*   User management: Administrators can manage user accounts, including creating new users, assigning roles, and resetting passwords.
*   Access control: The application enforces user permissions to ensure that only authorized users can access specific files or features.

### User Interaction
Users can navigate through the application using the sidebar, which contains links to different sections such as file upload, file sharing, and user settings. The main content area dynamically updates based on the selected section, allowing users to perform actions such as:

*   Uploading files: Users can upload files to the application, which are then stored securely on the server.
*   Viewing shared files: Users can view files shared with them by other users within their organization.
*   Managing account settings: Users can manage their account settings, including changing their password and updating their profile information.

### Data Handling
The application manages data using a secure backend that handles file uploads and downloads. All sensitive information is stored securely, and user permissions are enforced to ensure that only authorized users can access specific files or features. The application uses encryption to protect data during transmission, ensuring that all communications are secure.
